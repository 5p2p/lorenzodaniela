			<p>Hello to everybody and welcome! </p>

<p>with this web page we want to share the delight coming from our decision to get married, the choices and the life path we have made so far, but most of all we want to thank you because if you are reading it means that you are important to us. </p>

<p>Here below you can find some information about us and some practical guidelines for the wedding day.</p>

<h2 id="the-bride">THE BRIDE</h2>

<p><img class="float img-rounded" src="img/Picture2.jpg" /></p>

<p>DANIELA 33 years old, second child of mom Luigia and dad Vincenzo. Before she Roberto, born in Heaven, and then Chicco. Teacher enthusiastic of her job, her Sicily and trinkets with which she tries to create something new because she believes that everything can have a second chance. She loves the “low-speed” life but the love for her boyfriend has “forced” her to travel around Europe dealing with high speed trains and airplanes!!</p>

<h2 id="the-groom">THE GROOM</h2>

<p><img class="float img-rounded" src="img/Picture3.jpg" /></p>

<p>LORENZO 30 years old, the third of 4 beautiful big boys; with him: Ale, Marco and Ricky raised with a lot of love and patience from Mom Grazia and Dad Carlo. Researcher of the things of this world as of those “Above”, he studies in Braunschweig (DE) for some years. A lover of good beer (obviously dunkel ;p), good food, good company and high speed, sometimes he has to “slow down” to wait for her girlfriend that he loves.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">THE STORY</h2>

<h3 id="le-vie-del-cuore">LE VIE DEL CUORE</h3>
<p><img class="float img-rounded wide" src="img/Picture4.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>31° Franciscan pilgrimage to Assisi.</strong></p>

<p>Was the Franciscan pilgrimage the spark? Maybe … if you want to know more, <a href="http://5p2p.it/2013/06/19/fidanzati-senza-frontiere.html">read our story</a> or ask to us :-)</p>

<p>For further info about the Franciscan pilgrimage visit the website <a href="http://www.marciafrancescana.it/">www.marciafrancescana.it</a></p>

<h2 id="marriage">MARRIAGE</h2>

<p>When we found out that Someone immensely loved us, we couldn’t do anything else than returning that love with our YES. So here we are … </p>

<p>We believe that without the “paw” of Christ, without the gift of his Grace, we wouldn’t have got far and without His support we wouldn’t be able to keep the promise of eternal love. For this reason we want to get married in His name, because only mirroring us in Him we learn to love and to love each other. Following the direction He will suggest us we can achieve the goal of the project in which we are called: the full joy!</p>

<p>FRIAR MATTEO sparkling as Alka Seltzer, now he “sparkles” in the cloister Rezzato. Chet Atkins-like guitar player he plays the starlings to the eggplants at the cloister’s garden. Finally, when he has time, he deals with youth ministry.</p>

<h2 id="why-5p2p">WHY 5p2p</h2>

<p><img class="float img-rounded wide" src="img/Picture12.jpg" /></p>

<p>We got to know <a href="http://5p2p.it/">5pani2pesci</a> on web, but after being got into what we read, we wanted to meet its authors: Alessandra, Francesco Rao and their 3 children! So we visited them in Freiburg (Germany) where they are currently living. Welcoming, volcanic, generous and familiar. What they call “their poverty” actually it is their greatest wealth: they are able to devote themselves with humility and truth to someone who meets them. We want to support their evangelization project and if you want to know more visit their website: <a href="http://5p2p.it/">http://5p2p.it</a></p>
